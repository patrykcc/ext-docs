# Masternodes

## What is a masternode
Masternodes are computers that run an Exsolution wallet and make decisions, such as locking transactions with InstantSend, coordinate mixing of coins, and voting on budget funding.

## Requirements to run masternodes
Masternodes are required to have `10,000` Exsolution collateral, a dedicated IP address, and be able to run 24 hours a day without a more than a 1 hr connection loss.


Masternodes get paid 60% of the block reward on every block, which is distributed to masternodes one at a time. Typically (August 2018), 180 Exsolution is paid to each masternode every day.
