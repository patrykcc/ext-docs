# How to backup and restore Your EXT wallet
- - - -

## What is wallet file
`wallet.dat` is a file that holds private keys to spend outputs, addresses and transaction information.

It is the most important file in the wallet.
It is strongly recommended to _encrypt_ Your wallet by a **strong** password to prevent stealing by unauthorized persons who could obtain your wallet file.

:warning: **WARNING:** Keep in mind, that if You forget this password, You’ll never be able to decrypt wallet file and You will **lose** Your access to address and funds. So please make sure to **keep it safely** (you can back it up on a paper).

File has different locations based on the operating system. By default, file can be found in following locations:

* **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Exsolution`
* **Linux**: `~/.exsolution`
* **Mac OS X**: `~/Library/Application Support/exsolution/`

If you can’t find the location please refer to the bottom of this page.

## Restore
To restore the backup, simply copy your backed up `wallet.dat` over an existing one in the wallet data location.


# Default Location
## Windows
Go to Start _Menu -> Run_ (or press `WinKey+R`) and run this:
`%APPDATA%\Exsolution`

Exsolution data folder will open. For most users, this is the following location:

`C:\Users\_YourUserName_\Appdata\Roaming\Exsolution`

:warning: **Note:** `AppData` is an hidden folder by default.

## Linux
By default Exsolution will put its data here:
`~/.exsolution`

You need to do a `ls -a` to see directories that start with a dot.
If that’s not it, you can do a search like this:

## Mac
By default Exsolution will put its data here:
`~/Library/Application Support/Exsolution`
